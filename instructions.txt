You are Codex (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max) running as an autonomous senior engineer inside Codex CLI on my machine.

Goal
Upgrade my existing Next.js portfolio into a modern, premium, conversion-oriented personal site that reflects my real experience:
- Web development beyond Elementor (Next.js/React/TypeScript)
- WordPress/Elementor + SEO + landing pages + funnels
- Brand design (logos, flyers, business cards, social content)
- Automation with AI tools (Zapier, n8n, Make.com)
- Real client work: Prime Steam Care (logo + social + flyers + business cards), Baraka Wash (Houston SEO/service site), Omar Cuts, Absher 360 marketplace branding, and other local-business builds.

Non-negotiables (Frontend quality)
- Do NOT produce generic cookie-cutter portfolio layouts.
- Pick a clear, intentional visual direction (typography, color system, layout rhythm).
- Use expressive fonts (avoid default “Inter/Roboto/system” look) and set up next/font properly.
- Use a layered background (subtle gradients/shapes/patterns), not flat white.
- Add a few meaningful motion moments (page-load/stagger reveals), not spammy micro-animations.
- Must look excellent on mobile and desktop.

Tech stack & “latest and greatest” (choose pragmatically)
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui for UI primitives (buttons, cards, tabs, dialog)
- Framer Motion for animations
- next/image + next/font + metadata/OG tags done correctly
- Use MDX (or a light content approach) for case studies/blog if it helps; keep it simple and maintainable.
- Keep Lighthouse/perf in mind (optimize images, avoid heavy deps).

What to build / Information architecture
Implement a structure that sells my value and makes hiring me easy:
1) Home
   - Hero: clear positioning (Web Developer + Automation + Conversion/SEO + Brand)
   - “Proof” strip: key outcomes/skills (speed, SEO, automation, design systems)
   - Featured case studies (3–6)
   - Services (web dev, landing pages/funnels, SEO, automation, branding)
   - Process (short, confident)
   - Testimonials (if none, include a “Client Results” section with honest placeholders)
   - CTA (book a call / contact)

2) Work (case studies index)
   - Filterable cards (Website / Branding / Automation / SEO)
   - Each card shows: role, stack, deliverables, results, screenshots

3) Case Study template (dynamic route)
   For each project, a polished writeup structure:
   - Context, goals, constraints
   - What I did (bullet deliverables)
   - Stack/tools
   - Before/after or “problem → solution”
   - SEO/automation notes (where relevant)
   - Gallery + links

Seed case studies with my known projects:
- Prime Steam Care: logo + social content + flyers + business cards + before/after visuals
- Baraka Wash: Houston-focused cleaning site + SEO/service pages
- Omar Cuts: website work
- Absher 360: marketplace concept + branding direction (compass/gradient vibe)
(If the repo already has content, adapt; otherwise create these pages with realistic copy that I can edit.)

4) About
   - Short story (Houston-based vibe is fine if already present; avoid over-personal)
   - Skills grouped by outcomes (Conversion/SEO, Engineering, Automation, Design)
   - Tooling list (Next.js, React, TS, WP/Elementor, ACF/CPT, Tailwind, shadcn, Framer Motion, Zapier/n8n/Make)

5) Contact
   - Simple form (client-side + mailto fallback OR server action if already set up)
   - Clear CTA and quick response expectations

Repo-wide improvements
- Add a consistent design system: Tailwind tokens via CSS variables, spacing scale, typography scale.
- Add OG/Twitter images and fix metadataBase correctly (no localhost in prod).
- Add sitemap.xml + robots.txt (simple + correct).
- Add a clean README that explains stack, scripts, and how to deploy.
- Make sure the site builds and runs (`npm run build`, `npm run lint` if configured).

Working style
- Be tool-first: use `rg` to search, `ls`/directory tools to map the codebase, read files before editing.
- Make changes end-to-end: implement + verify by running tests/build where possible.
- Don’t stop after “planning”; deliver working code and a polished UI.
- Keep diffs readable and avoid unnecessary churn.

Step 1 (start now)
1) Inspect the repo structure (app router? pages router?), dependencies, styling approach.
2) Propose 2–3 distinct visual directions (brief names + 3 bullets each) based on my profile.
3) Pick the best direction and implement it across the key pages.
4) Build the new IA and seed the case studies.

Acceptance criteria
- The site feels premium and intentional (not generic).
- Navigation and content structure make my services and experience instantly clear.
- Case studies are easy to scan and persuasive.
- Mobile experience is excellent.
- Build passes locally.
- Metadata/OG previews work with a real production base URL.

Proceed.
